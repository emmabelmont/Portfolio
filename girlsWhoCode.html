    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid grey" class="w3-round">
    <p>I am in the 2017 Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program at Blackrock. I joined to learn more about coding, meet others who share similar interests, and to see how coding and other computer science aspects are used in the work place. Throught the program I have learned Scratch, HTML, CSS, Python, Robotics, JavaScript, and many other valueble skills.</p>

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid grey" class="w3-round">
    <h3 class="w3-text-black"><b>HTML/CSS</b></h3>

   <p>I am trying to make my website accessible to all users by trying to make it easy to opperate/navigate and physically appealing. I found that others incorporated colorful backrounds, photos, or appealing fonts to their websites which I really liked. I am most proud of learning html today and how to incorporate CSS into my code to make it more creative and appealing. I'm also proud that I learned how to created a website in such a short amount of time.</p>
   
   <h3 class="w3-text-black"><b>Core 4</b></h3>
      <p>The Core4 I learned are variables, loops, conditionals, and functions.</p>
	    <p><b>Variable:</b> A variable is used to store a value. There are different types of variables depending on the data type being stored such as integers, decimals, or characters. </p>
          <img src="https://github.com/emmabelmont/portfolio/blob/gh-pages/varaible.PNG?raw=true" style="width:100%">
	    <p><b>Conditional:</b> A conditional is a statement that controls the execution of a code that depends on a condition.</p>
          <img src="https://github.com/emmabelmont/portfolio/blob/gh-pages/conditional.PNG?raw=true" style="width:100%">
	    <p><b>Loop:</b> A loop repeat sequences of code for a fixed number of times or while a condition is true.   </p>
          <img src="https://github.com/emmabelmont/portfolio/blob/gh-pages/loop.PNG?raw=true" style="width:100%">
	    <p><b>Function:</b> A function is a block of code that can be reused to preform a specific action. </p>
          <img src="https://github.com/emmabelmont/portfolio/blob/gh-pages/function.PNG?raw=true" style="width:100%">
   
   <h3 class="w3-text-black"><b>Obamicon Filter Project</b></h3>

  <p>A list is a data structure that stores data of any data type and is written in square brackets [] that can be appended and extended. A list is helpful when dealing with a lot of data. </p>
      <p> The most helpful group I worked with was when researching tools. I now understand the difference between list.append and list. extend, how to slice lists, how to search lists using list.index(), and tuples. </p>
      <p>For my Obamacon Project, I created a filter that changes the pixel color of a picture that is selected by the user. This is an example of before and after of a picture that I applied the filter to. </p>

   <h3 class="w3-text-black"><b>New York Stock Exchange Fieldtrip</b></h3>

   <p>I am so thankful that Blackrock gave me this amazing experience of being able to stand up on the podium for the New York Stock Exchange Friday Closing Bell Ceremony. The experience was surreal and I cannot explain my gratitude for Blackrock and The Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. Having the oppertunity to be on live television and to meet people who work on the floor of the NYSE was a remarkable experience, and being able to represent this outstanding program and Blackrock was truely a once in a lifetime oppertunity and I am so grateful. </p>
   
   <h3 class="w3-text-black"><b>Robotics Unit</b></h3>

   <p>My favorite part of robotics was wearable technology. I enjoyed it because when you made a change in your code there was a direct change. I also found it interesting to hear about all the great things people were able to do with the Circuit Playground. I'm grateful to have the opportunity to learn how to use it and hopefully create something that can help people around the world. </p>
   
   <h3 class="w3-text-black"><b>Gibson Dunn Fieldtrip</b></h3>

   <p>I enjoyed the trip to Gibson Dunn becasue I loved hearing from all the different speakers about all their experiences and their work that they have done that has benefitted our society. Their work was inspiring and I thouroughly enjoyed hearing about their great work.</p>
